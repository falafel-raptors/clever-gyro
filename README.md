## User Stories
* USER
  * I want an intuitive U/I that is easily understood.
  * I want a visually appealing site.
  * I want to be able to play the game on both mobile and non-mobile devices.
  * I want to know the rules before playing the game.
  * I want to keep my data - scores and place in game - if I navigate away from the page.
  * I want a game that is both fun and challenging.
  * I want to be able to choose if I need to complete the game in a specified amount of time
  * I want to be able to choose if the numbers vanish from the buttons.

* DEVELOPER
  * I want DRY and readable code.
  * I want modular code to make building the product easy.
  * I would like to have the numbers balanced for ease of play for the user (2 positive and 2 negative).
  * I would like to only show the instructions to new users, not to repeat users - unless requested.
  * I want to incorporate an easter egg into the game - to complete the game you reach the number and then get to navigate to the About Us page
  * I want to eliminate edge cases.
  * I want to be able to add a easy/medium/hard mode - increased ranges and multiple operators for difficult purposes.
  
## Conflict Plan
* What will our group do when it encounters conflict?
  * put it to a vote
    * every day one person gets a double vote, only in the event of a tie

* How will you raise concerns to members who are not adiquately contributing?
  * in our daily standup
  * start from a place of support with a whole message
  * "I" statements

* What is your process to resolve conflicts?
  * ensure members are fed and sufficiently watered
  * allow members to take reasonably timed breaks
  * create a safe space where everyone is able to be heard and valued
  * to change our coding environment to ensure members are happy and productive

* How and when will you escalate the conflict resolution?
  * circle conflict resolution moment
    * close laptops
    * use "talking stick" to ensure all concerns are aired and expressed
    * when circle ends, the issue is CLOSED. Resolution complete.
  * if circle cannot solve, bring issue to the TA first, then Nicholas last
